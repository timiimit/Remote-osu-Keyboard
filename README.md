# Remote osu! Keyboard
Use Remote osu! Keyboard as a keyboard for standard osu!, mania, taiko and catch the beat modes.
This makes playing silent and ideal for newcomers to osu.
All you need is a Wi-Fi connection. It doesn't have to be fast, because Remote osu! Keyboard sends as little data as possible across the network.

## Installation
 - Download Android app from Google Play Store
 - Download [Server](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16ohVKJFSsxtFd0uCh7lQyO3tLUm6P6Tv) to your computer from Google Drive
 - Extract downloaded zip with password "Ro!KS" (without quotes)
 - Start Server and you're good to go :D

### My antivirus software detects server as a virus
Ever since I've created this program I got a lot and I MEAN A LOT of messages regarding this.
Server program on Google Drive contains no virus! Some antivirus softwares just think it is a virus
because it is pressing keyboard keys, which is something that normal applications don't do.

I can't give you proof of that. It's up to you to decide to trust me or not. Just don't send me messages about this.
If you decide not to trust me on this just don't download/use it.

### Why does zip have password?
Just like some antivirus softwares detect server as a virus, google drive would too and also prevent you from downloading it.
This way Google Drive can't do a virus scan on the content of the zip file.

### Why was Ro!K's official forum thread deleted?
Someone asked Peppy to remove it because it is distributing virus software and he deleted the thread.
It's a reasnable thing to do. I would do the same if something like that was on my website.
